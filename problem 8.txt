assuming we have a tree version of each game 
and we have two tables with game id, statue and table with manufactory data we need to join both tables by the Id
First, we are going to store every version of a gameâ€™s statue in the array with its serial number 
then we store every game manufactory data and id in hash table
we are going check about each game statue with the first false statue by for loop get its id  
then search about its Id(serial number) in the hash table O(n)
then get the first manufactory data with false statue
