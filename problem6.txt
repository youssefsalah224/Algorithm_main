we have an employee’s table which have the ID and transaction table which have the foreign key
1-First we will insert the employees table in hash table 
2-Then we will ably a for loop on the transition table by the Id(the foreign key) -- O(m)
3-Then We will search about id in the hash table --O(1)
So that the total order is now linear—O(m)
